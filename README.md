# Clario test app

Its a simple flutter sign up page created as a test task for Clario. I decided not to use any of external libraries for creating validation, rather I created my simple validation and input field. App is created with Flutter.
To start the app you need to run these commands:

- `flutter pub get`
- `flutter run`
